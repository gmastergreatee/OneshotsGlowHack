This project is created to help starters`(not pros & whoever comes in between)` to get up to speed with the high skill level required in online server matches against human players in community servers.

NOTE : Use it at your own risk, no warranties what-so-ever.

Release download : click [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gmastergreatee/oneshotsglowhack/build/artifacts)

And no, __Aimbot__ will not be integrated as `wall-hack` must be enough for starters

Make sure to run the hack with __"admin"__ privileges for it to work correctly.

```
IMPORTANT : After downloading, you would need to update the hack.
